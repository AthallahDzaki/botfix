Grace is a Discord bot in development, using Discord.js master branch, the goal is to be the more complete as possible, keeping a good performance. There's no stable release yet and if you're a Discord member, you can give suggestions or just join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QtnPqZg).
What we have so far:
  - Essential features: user reactions, ban/kick command, purge messages, show a user profile picture, play songs(without ffmpeg) with playlist for guilds, currency.
  - Another features: Try to find a specific user by his display name (you can test it with the Discord profile picture command), allow users to have their personal song playlist and add songs to the guild queue from it.

Redis is a requeriment to run as it's used as a good in-memory database.
